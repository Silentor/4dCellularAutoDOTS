# 4dCellularAutoDOTS
2-3-4D cellular automata simulator+visualizer using Unity DOTS
## Preface
The main goal is to learn some practical features of DOTS in the fields of simulation and rendering. I want to experiment with various approaches for visualizing 4D geometry, particularly with a 4D grid of hypercubes. To bring this system to life, we will use cellular automata with some forces influencing the grid. It's easier to begin with a 2D implementation and then extend it to 3D and 4D. There are visualization challenges for high-dimensional systems: I need a carving solution to look inside the 3D grid, and the same, with w-coordinate variation, for the 4D grid.
## What i want to learn
ECS, Jobs, Burst. Full ECS approach for generation, simulation and visualization of cellular automata. Vectorization. Some input processing for viewing different parts of grid (for higher dimensions).
## How to use the results
There are some ideas of global map consist of isolated islands, but in 4D space globally. So weather effects, magical energy currents, ripples of time-changing effects must be evolved in 4d space
