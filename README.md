# 4dCellularAutoDOTS
2-3-4D cellular automata simulator+visualizer using Unity DOTS
## Preface
The main goal is to learn some practical features of DOTS in the fields of simulation and rendering. I want to experiment with various approaches for visualizing 4D geometry, particularly with a 4D grid of hypercubes. To bring this system to life, we will use cellular automata with some forces influencing the grid. It's easier to begin with a 2D implementation and then extend it to 3D and 4D. There are visualization challenges for high-dimensional systems: I need a carving solution to look inside the 3D grid, and the same, with w-coordinate variation, for the 4D grid.
## What i want to learn
ECS, Jobs, Burst. Full ECS approach for generation, simulation and visualization of cellular automata. Vectorization. Some input processing for viewing different parts of grid (for higher dimensions).
## How to use the results
There are some ideas of global map consist of isolated islands, but in 4D space globally. So weather effects, magical energy currents, ripples of time-changing effects must be evolved in 4d space

## Results
**There are some simple simulations on self-looped (boundless but finite) grids in different spaces.**

Heat dissipation simulation on **2D** grid (100x100 = 10 000 cells). Perfomance is not a concern there. Red is hot, violet is cold...

The next video is a wave simulation on the **3D** grid (100x100x100 = 1 000 000 cells). Every cell is visualized as a white box on the screen. There is no culling, all cells draw at once. We can see a carving feature to peek inside the grid (and make waves from inside). Also, we can see a time freeze feature. FPS is not good because there are a million cells to simulate and a million boxes to render :)

Finally, **4D** space, hypercubes, and stuff! It's a spread of some magical corruption simulation on the 4D grid (40x40x40x40 = 2 560 000 cells). The grid is so small linearly because the cost of simulation in 4D sums up very quickly. We can see a w-coord changing feature because we cannot render 4D boxes directly (still waiting for Unity4D).  So we can not only look inside the grid via carving but outside too (in fourth dimension). I'm using the 4D perlin noise for evil looking non-uniform spread.
